This is a repository to store code that I am studying currently.

## Games

This folder contains projects related to game development.

### 2D JS Engine

This is a project to make a 2D physics engine in JavaScript. The folder [legacy](Games/2d-js-engine/legacy) contains a project that was created as an activity of Physics Simulation for Games class, this activity generated the idea of building the engine to understand was was covered by the class and advanced topics that were not covered.

## HakerRank

This folder contains solutions of [HakerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/) problems. 

The script [assert.py](HackerRank/assert.py) is a script that is used to input data, run the solutions and compare with the expected result for every problem solved. The usage is simple, the parameter is the folder that contains the solution, the inputs and expected result files (the files must follow the patter N.in for inputs or N.expected for expected results, N is the index of test case)

```bash
python .\assert.py .\repeated-string\
```
