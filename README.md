# Studies

This is a repository to store code that I am studying currently.

## HakerRank

This the folder that solutions of [HakerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"} problems are stored. 

The script [assert.py](HackerRank/assert.py) is a script that is used to input data, run the solutions and compare with the expected result for every problem solved. The usage is simple, the parameter is the folder that contains the solution, the inputs and expected result files (the files must follow the patter N.in for inputs or N.expected for expected results, N is the index of test case)

```bash
python assert.py new-york-chaos
```
